    <p class="text-muted">The Vision for Campus Master Planning

      Foothill's campus embodies the mission as a safe, nurturing, and inclusive community.  Common spaces flow naturally from the classrooms and other structures to foster and sustain communal learning; these spaces are therefore open and strategically placed to inspire spontaneous gathering and interaction among students and teachers and promote an egalitarian, welcoming spirit. Where appropriate, campus pathways curve and wind to convey softness and warmth and encourage a slower pace.  The whole of the campus can be taken in from any number of vantage points, much like the way we strive to see the whole child in every aspect of our learning program. The design of the learning spaces features natural light and renewable materials, and prioritizes collaboration, individual attention, and flexibility.  Green spaces are abundant for play, gathering, reflecting, and taking in the beauty of the natural environment.  The campus serves as the location for a virtuous learning neighborhood; a place where all children feel a sense of belonging, a desire to explore and know the larger world, and a responsibility to serve the best interests of the whole community.</p>

    <p class="text-muted">

      “Every student should have a library book in his or her possession at all times,” said our founder Howell Webb.

That philosophy has been a key part of the School’s culture from the beginning, and the Betty Webb Library is the heart of Foothill Country Day School.      

The Library is home to over 32,000 volumes that are checked out on a daily basis with state-of-the-art circulation software.  The Library building, and especially the Canary Room, provide a nurturing environment to encourage the love of reading in our students.
 
Our librarian Shawn Clark connects with every student on campus as she is very involved in matching children’s needs with the books they enjoy.  She also oversees computerized assessments such as Accelerated Reader and STAR reading tests.  The Library is also used to host special events throughout the year, such as campus visits and book signings from best-selling authors.

  The Arts Program enjoys a long and rich history at Foothill Country Day School with dedicated music, visual art, and performance space facilities providing an engaging arts experience.

  Kindergarten through 5th grade students receive weekly instruction in visual and vocal arts, and every student has the opportunity to perform in a play each year. Beginning in 3rd grade, students can also join the Foothill Orchestra as an after school program. 
  
  Upper School students explore the arts twice a week in the Elective Arts Block in which they can select their own arts-related classes from a slate of different electives. Classes offered include filmmaking, ceramics, music technology, creative robotics, stagecraft and robotics.

On the app there will be a button that says announce and during dismissal whoever picks up the child must press the announce button on the cellphone in oreder for there child to come to get picked up. The announcement goes to the teacher in the classroom and the teacher tells the student to go. That is how the new PikmyKid system works. </p>
